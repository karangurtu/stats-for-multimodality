# Statistics for Multimodality: why, when, how â€“ an invitation

In these pages we show you how to perform the analyses described in the paper step-by-step. This will not be a full introduction to R -- there are several very good resources available for this in any case and we'll give some links below. What we will show is how to go from nothing to the state of being able to execute the code examples in the paper. You can then build on this, preferably by consulting some of the other more detailed introductions that are available.
