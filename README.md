# Statistics for Multimodality: why, when, how â€“ an invitation

In these pages we show you how to perform the analyses described in the paper step-by-step. This will not be a full introduction to R -- there are several very good resources available for this in any case and we'll give some links below. What we will show is how to go from nothing to the state of being able to execute the code examples in the paper. You can then build on this, preferably by consulting some of the other more detailed introductions that are available.

## Installing R

Before running any R code, you have to install the R program on your computer; we will assume that this has not been done and you are using a computer without R already present. In fact, we will recommend installing two programs: the basic 'R engine' that does all the work, and a further 'development environment' that makes it easy to create R programs, edit and save them, and run them to get results. Both are free software and are available for Windows, Macs, and Linux operating systems. 

First, installing R. For this, you need to go to the relevant website for the R project and download the installation program that is appropriate for your operating system. The core R website is at: https://www.r-project.org/. 

The development environment we recommend for using R is called RStudio. This also has to be downloaded and installed. The website for RStudio is: https://www.rstudio.com/.
