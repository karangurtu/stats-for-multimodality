# Statistics for Multimodality: why, when, how â€“ an invitation

In these pages we show you how to perform the analyses described in the paper step-by-step. This will not be a full introduction to R -- there are several very good resources available for this in any case and we'll give some links below. What we will show is how to go from nothing to the state of being able to execute the code examples in the paper. You can then build on this, preferably by consulting some of the other more detailed introductions that are available.

## Installing R

Before running any R code, you have to install the R program on your computer; we will assume that this has not been done and you are using a computer without R already present. In fact, we will recommend installing two programs: the basic 'R engine' that does all the work, and a further 'development environment' that makes it easy to create R programs, edit and save them, and run them to get results. Both are free software and are available for Windows, Macs, and Linux operating systems. 

First, installing R. For this, you need to go to the relevant website for the R project and download the installation program that is appropriate for your operating system. The core R website is at: https://www.r-project.org/. 

The development environment we recommend for using R is called RStudio. This also has to be downloaded and installed. The website for RStudio is: https://www.rstudio.com/. 

## How to use this repository
For the present, we list here some of the basic instructions and bits of code that let you carry out the examples in the paper and load data of your own. This may well become more elaborated as time goes on, and if there are specific requests, readers are invited to get in contact with us directly.

## Loading data into R
As stated in the paper, loading data into R is quite straightforward, so we describe this here rather than taking up space in the published paper. You can also then directly copy bits of code as required. We will illustrate how to get data from Excel or some other spreadsheet program into R so that you can run the tets that are described in the paper.

## Comparing measurements and counts: t-test and chi-square test

If you have loaded the data as described in the previous section, then you can just perform the tests as given in the paper. More specifically, we can use the R operator of *selecting columns* to cmopare any collections of measurements or scores from a bigger table of data, or dataframe. 

## Measuring statistical power

A large number of effect size online calculators for different statistical tests can be found here: http://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html. The paper sets out some of the basic ways of using these for the tests described in the paper.

## Measuring agreement between annotators
Described in the paper.

## Literature and additional resources
To be extended.
